        <h2>Essay</h2>
        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, born on February 5, 1985, in Madeira, Portugal, is one of football's greatest icons. 
            Known for his extraordinary talent, relentless work ethic, and unyielding determination, Ronaldo has achieved unprecedented success across multiple leagues. 
            Starting his career at Sporting CP, he gained global recognition at Manchester United, where he won his first Ballon d'Or. 
            His tenure at Real Madrid cemented his legacy, as he became the clubâ€™s all-time top scorer and won five Champions League titles. 
            Ronaldo's versatility, pace, and scoring ability set him apart. His dedication to physical fitness has allowed him to maintain peak performance well into his 30s, breaking age-related norms in professional sports. 
            Beyond his club achievements, Ronaldo has also been instrumental in Portugal's success, leading them to victory in the 2016 UEFA European Championship. Off the pitch, he is a global brand and philanthropist, inspiring millions worldwide.</p>
